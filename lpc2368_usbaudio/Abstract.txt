The Audio project is a demo program for the Keil MCB2300
Board using the Philips LPC2368 Microcontroller.

It demonstrates an USB Audio Device - Speaker.

The USB Audio Device is recognized by the host PC running
Windows which will load a generic Audio driver and add a
speaker which can be used for sound playback on the PC.
Potenciometer on the board is used for setting the Volume
and the LEDs are used to display a simplified VU Meter.

The Audio program is available for the following targets:
  MCB2300 Board: configured for on-chip Flash ROM
                 (used for production or target debugging)

Note: set jumper J5 to 1[2 3] (jumper towards JTAG connector)
      for USB soft connect
