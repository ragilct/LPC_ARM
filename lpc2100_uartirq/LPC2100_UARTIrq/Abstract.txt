Interrupt-Driven UART I/O For Philips LPC2100 ARM Devices
===========================================================
This example program provides easily configurable interrupt-driven
UART I/O routines.  The buffer sizes for receive and transmit may
be independently configured to 2,4,8,16,32,64,128,... bytes long.

Routines to send and receive characters are included along with
routines that return the number of characters in either buffer.

Included are fputc and fgetc routines that interface printf
and scanf to the interrupt-driven serial I/O routines.

UART I/O is handled in a separate file (SIO.C) that you can use
in your own programs.  This example works with Philips LPC2100 devices.

The program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:  runs in software Simulator
              Serial Window #2
  MCB2100:    runs from Internal Flash located on chip
              COM1, 115200 baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity
