This simple BLINKY project shows several techniques
that are useful on the Philips LPC2100 series.

It changes constantly the status on the output port
GPIO P1.16..23.

The example shows:

  - how to setup the Vector Interrupt controller.
  - how to setup timer0 for timer interrupts.
  - how to change the port.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  Simulator:     configured for software Simulator

  MCB2100 Flash: configured for on-chip Flash ROM
                 (used for production or target debugging)

  MCB2100 RAM:   configured to run from on-chip RAM
                 (may be used for target debugging)
