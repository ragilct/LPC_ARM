The IAP project shows how to use IAP function calls for 
In-Application Programming of the on-chip Flash ROM.

At start of the program there is a delay loop for debugger
synchronization.  For details refer to:
   http://www.keil.com/support/docs/2767.htm

This demo first programs some values into the Flash ROM and
Erases then the content of this Flash ROM.

The IAP program is available in different targets:
  MCB2100_V162:   runs on the MCB2100 Board with disabled PLL
                  to bypass the IAP.1 problem described in the
				  Philips errata sheet (runs on boot loader before
				  V1.63)

  MCB2100_V163:   runs on the MCB2100 Board with enabled PLL

  MCB2130:        runs on the MCB2130 Board

This program may be even tested in the uVision Simulator
when using CARM Version 2.20 or higher.
