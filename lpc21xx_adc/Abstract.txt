Analog to Digital Converter Example Program
===========================================


This example program shows how to configure and use the
A/D Converter of the following microcontrollers:

* Philips LPC 2114/2119/2124/2129/2131/2132/2138/2194

After configuring the A/D Converter, the program reads
A/D channel 0 and outputs the converted value using the serial 
port.


To run this program...

1. Select the Device (Project - Options for Target - Device)
2. Build the project (Project - Build Target)
3. Start the uVision Debugger
4. Open the Serial Window (View - Serial Window 1)
5. Click Run (F5)
6. Click on the Toolbox buttons to change input voltages


A debug script (debug.ini) creates buttons that set different 
analog values in A/D channels.  As the program runs, you 
will see the A/D input and output change.

Other buttons create signals that generate sine wave 
or sawtooth patterns as analog inputs.  µVision3 users may 
enable the built-in Logic Analyzer to view, measure and compare
these input signals graphically.
