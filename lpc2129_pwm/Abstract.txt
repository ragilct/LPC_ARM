The PWM project is a simple program for the LPC2129
using Keil MCB2100 Microcontroller Board.

It adjusts PWM2 and PWM3 phases according to the Potentiometer.

The PWM program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:      runs in software Simulator
  MCB2100 RAM:    runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                       (used for target debugging) 
  MCB2100 Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                       (used for final aplication version)


The output of PWM2 is P0.7; PWM3 can be found on P0.1

The built-in Logic Analyzer shows the varying pulse width 
as the input to the ADC changes.
